Oh hai, these are a collection of mods I have made for the amazing game Satisfactory. 
These are not open source but here as a resouce if anyone wants to learn from anything I've made or implemented. 
All rights reserved by Muppet Burrito for most things here, and Bababooie for the assets they have made for our shared mod Decor +. 
If you wish to use or replicate any of the assets in these packs please contact me on the Satisfactory Modding Discord, permission may be granted if requested, depending. 
Otherwise both Bababooie and I are available for modding and modelling requests and commissions by contacting us either through the Satisfactory Modding Discord or on here. 
Thank y'all, happy modding, and have a great day!
